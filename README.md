# Environment

Python 3.10 is required to run PBench. To set up the environment, follow the steps below:

1. Install Python 3.10

    ```
    sudo apt-get install python3.10
    ```

2. Install required packages

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Workload

[Snowset](https://github.com/resource-disaggregation/snowset) contains several statistics (timing, I/O, resource usage, etc..) pertaining to ~70 million queries from all customers that ran on [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) over a 14 day period from Feb 21st 2018 to March 7th 2018. PBench uses the statistics in Snowset to synthesize database workloads.

# Usage

PBench can synthesize database workloads using different methods. The following sections describe how to use each method.

## Configuration

Conguration can be set in `PBench-tool/config/*.yml`.

This document provides a brief overview of the configuration parameters specified in the YAML file. The setup is designed to generate and execute workloads efficiently.

- **Workload Path**: `../../Workloads/Snowset/workload1h-5m-30s_1.csv`  
  This file specifies the original workload file.

- **Workload Name**: `workload1h-5m-30s_1`  
  A unique identifier for the workload, facilitating easy referencing and logging.

- **Count Limit**: `1000`  
  Sets the maximum number of operations or queries to be executed during the workload.

- **Time Limit**: `270` seconds  
  Defines the total duration within the time-window which all operations must be completed.

- **Use Operator**: `1`  
  Indicates whether the operation involves using operator target (value 1 suggests usage).

- **Interval**: `30` seconds  
  Determines the interval between operations or queries execution cycles.

- **Query Types**: `[TPCH, TPCH, TPCH, TPCH, tpcds_all, tpcds_all, imdb, llm]`  
  Lists the types of queries included in the workload, covering different datasets and benchmarks.

- **Database Names**: `[tpch500m, tpch1g, tpch5g, tpch9g, tpcds1g, tpcds2g, imdb, llm]`  
  Corresponds to the databases against which the queries will be executed, each representing different sizes or datasets.

- **Operator Scale**: `100`  
  Scaling factors affecting the operation's intensity or frequency.

- **Initial Count**: `10`  
  Specifies the initial target number of queries in time-window.

## Baseline experiments

The baseline tools include two widely known workload synthesizer: CAB and Stitcher. We provide our implementation and startup code in `Baseline/do_baseline.py`.

## PBench

To synthesize database workloads by PBench, follow the steps below:

1. Collect the statistics of queries

    ```
    python Collect_metrics/collect.py 
    ```

2. Synthesize workload and replay

    ```
    python PBench-tool/run_pbench.py
    ```

Parameters of PBench can be set in `PBench-tool/configs`.
